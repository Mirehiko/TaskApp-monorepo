[comment]: <> (> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.)

[comment]: <> (When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.)

[comment]: <> (## Generate a library)

[comment]: <> (Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.)

[comment]: <> (> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.)

[comment]: <> (Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@taskapp/mylib`.)

[comment]: <> (## Development server)

[comment]: <> (Run `nx serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.)

[comment]: <> (## Code scaffolding)

[comment]: <> (Run `nx g @nrwl/react:component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.)

[comment]: <> (## Build)

[comment]: <> (Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.)
